## 😤 **The Problem You're Dealing With**

You know the drill:

- 📁 **Searching through dozens of folders** to find last month's proposal
- ❓ **"Where did Sarah save the contract?"** (She doesn't remember either)
- 📧 **Clients asking for documents** you KNOW exist but can't locate
- 🗂️ **Everyone naming files differently** ("Final Draft", "FINAL_v2", "Use This One")
- 😰 **Audits, compliance reviews, legal requests** = panic mode

**You're not disorganized. Your file system is.**

---

## ✅ **What Root File Manager Does**

Root gives you a **professional file organization system** that works the same way across every project, every client, every department.

### **Think of it like:**
- A filing cabinet with the same drawer labels for every client
- A recipe you follow every time (no guessing)
- A template your whole team uses (consistency finally)

### **What you get:**

✅ **One Structure for Everything**
- Construction projects → Same 5 folders
- Legal cases → Same 5 folders  
- IT projects → Same 5 folders
- Manufacturing jobs → Same 5 folders

✅ **Clear File Naming Rules**
- No more "Final_Draft_v2_USETHISONE.docx"
- Every file tagged with: Date + Client + Project + Type
- Example: `2025-01-17_ACME-Corp_Proposal_Website-Redesign.pdf`

✅ **Your Team Actually Uses It**
- Simple enough your intern understands it
- Professional enough your CFO approves it
- Works with Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint - whatever you use

---

## 🏗️ **How It Works (The 5-Folder System)**

Every project gets the same 5 folders. That's it.

| **Folder** | **What Goes Here** | **Why It Matters** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **1-PROJECT-INFO** | Scope, team contacts, meeting notes | The "what and who" of the project |
| **2-COMMUNICATIONS** | Emails, texts, call logs | All conversations in one place |
| **3-DOCUMENTS** | Contracts, proposals, specs | Important legal/technical papers |
| **4-DELIVERABLES** | Final work, completed reports | What you actually delivered |
| **5-BILLING** | Invoices, receipts, payments | Money tracking (for you or accountant) |

**Why this order?**
1. You start a project (folder 1)
2. You communicate with the client (folder 2)
3. You sign paperwork (folder 3)
4. You do the work (folder 4)
5. You get paid (folder 5)

**Chronological. Logical. Brain-dead simple.**

## 🏢 **About xsvStudio**

We're a project management and technology consulting firm based in Philadelphia, specializing in complex infrastructure projects.

**Our background:**
- 20+ years managing $1.8B+ in construction, healthcare, industrial, and legal projects
- Healthcare construction (hospital renovations, sterile environments, ICRA Class IV/V)
- Industrial manufacturing (zero-downtime upgrades, GMP/FDA compliance)
- Commercial real estate (tenant improvements, lease negotiations)
- Legal compliance (contract forensics, audit defense)

**We built Root to solve OUR OWN file chaos.** After 20 years of managing massive projects, we realized:
- Generic file systems don't work for complex operations
- Every team names files differently (disaster)
- Finding documents during audits was a nightmare
- Training new hires on "our system" took weeks

**So we built Root. It worked so well we turned it into a product.**

**We're not software developers selling you vaporware. We're project managers who eat our own dog food daily.**
